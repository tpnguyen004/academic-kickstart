Tri (Alex) Nguyen is a Ph.D. candidate in the Applied Mathematics program at the University of California, Merced under the academic supervision of Mayya Tokman. As an applied mathematician the scope of his work encompasses mathematical modeling, numerical analysis, and scientific computing. His research interests includes mathematical investigations into complex systems which typically exhibit multi-scale phenomena. His current work focuses on developing advanced mathematical techniques to improve computational performance of particle simulation models of plasma and accelerator physics.

He graduated from the University of California, San Diego in 2013 with a B.S. in Economics and Mathematics. From 2014 to 2016 he attended the graduate program in Mathematics at the California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. In 2016 he entered the Ph.D. program in Applied Mathematics at the University of California, Merced where he is now a Ph.D. candidate. Prior to his academic trajectory, he worked in numerous technical positions in the wireless industry, was a U.S. Marine, and for a very brief period of time was a cartoonist.
