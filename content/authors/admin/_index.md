Tri (Alex) Nguyen is a Ph.D. candidate in the Applied Mathematics program at the University of California, Merced under the academic supervision of Mayya Tokman. He graduated from the University of California, San Diego in 2013 with a Bachelor of Science in Economics and Mathematics. He then attended the (Masters) graduate program in Mathematics at the California State Polytechnic University, Pomona from 2014 to 2016. In 2016 he entered the Ph.D. program in Applied Mathematics at the University of California, Merced. Prior to his academic trajectory, he worked in numerous technical positions in the wireless industry, was a U.S. Marine, and for a very brief period of time was a cartoonist. His current work focuses on developing advanced mathematical techniques to improve computational performance of simulating charged particle dynamics in particle simulation models of plasma and accelerator physics.
